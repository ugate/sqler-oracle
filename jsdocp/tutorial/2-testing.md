Tests are conducted using a _lightweight_ version of the Oracle DB called [Oracle XE (Xpress Edition)](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/xe.html).

### Oracle XE
A one-time setup must be conducted on the machine that will be running the tests. Refer to [Testing with Oracle XE](https://github.com/ugate/repo/tree/master/oracle#readme) for documentation on how to setup the required test database environment.
